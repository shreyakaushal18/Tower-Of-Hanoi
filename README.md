Tower of Hanoi implemented using recursion

## What is Tower of Hanoi?
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle/game involving three rods and a number of disks of different sizes.
The disks are stacked on one rod in decreasing size, with the largest at the bottom and smallest at the top. The objective is to move the entire stack from the source rod to the destination rod, using the auxiliary/helper rod as help.

## Rules of Tower of Hanoi

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. You can move only the top disk from any rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
